<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Senior Software Test Engineer with a passion for delivering quality products.</p>

<p>With my original career background being in photography my eye for detail helps me excel in my current role.</p>

<p>I'm an avid cyclist and love getting out on group rides on the weekends. 
  Another passion is coffee. I've been home roasting coffee for the past 3 years. 
  There's something so satisfying about being able to produce an amazing cup of coffee in your own home.</p>
